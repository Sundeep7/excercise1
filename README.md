# Exercise1

Features of Exercise1 app:

1. Global and modular initialization and structuring of SCSS.
2. Creation of modular app: focusing breaking of components.
3. Placeholders propotions are used in whole app in place of actual images.
4. Hot loading.
5. Additional: Lazy Loaded feature - modular app based implementation. Angular with webpack is also implemented for chunk optimization, teplating, hot loading etc.


Note: Exact test content is not used, each component is represented in build and used text that makes sense for each of those components.

It works in a responsive manner.

The right hand column is fixed, whilst the left hand column is fluidic. If the width is too small, the right tiles should come below the left column.

The font for body used is Arial.

Every detailed different ui is captured separately. Navigation has only two navs since only one nav is workable.

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests in Client

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
